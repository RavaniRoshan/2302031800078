# Library Management System

This repository contains the wireframes and diagrams for a Library Management System, as required for the college assignment.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design a Library Management System. This includes creating wireframes to visualize the user interface and designing various diagrams (DFD, ER, UML) to represent the system's architecture and behavior.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `WireFrames/`: This folder contains the PDF document with the wireframes for the Library Management System.
- `Diagrams/`: This folder contains the PDF document with the DFD, ER-Diagram, and UML diagrams (Use Case, Sequence, Activity, Class) for the Library Management System.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## About the Repository

This repository is created for the submission of the college assignment. The repository is named with the enrollment number as per the assignment instructions.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-enrollment-number.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the folders:**
   - To view the wireframes, go to the `WireFrames` folder and open the PDF file.
   - To view the diagrams, go to the `Diagrams` folder and open the PDF file.

## About the Wireframes

The `WireFrames` folder contains a PDF document with at least eight wireframes for the Library Management System. These wireframes cover the key features of the system and provide a visual representation of the user interface.

## About the Diagrams

The `Diagrams` folder contains a PDF document with the following diagrams for the Library Management System:

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** Shows the flow of data within the system.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:** Represents the relationships between entities in the system.
- **UML Diagrams:**
  - **Use Case Diagram:** Describes the interactions between users and the system.
  - **Sequence Diagram:** Shows the sequence of interactions between objects in the system.
  - **Activity Diagram:** Represents the workflow of the system.
  - **Class Diagram:** Describes the structure of the system by showing its classes, attributes, and relationships.
