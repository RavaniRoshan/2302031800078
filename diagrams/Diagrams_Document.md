# Library Management System Diagrams

This document contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD), Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and all required UML diagrams for the Library Management System (LMS).

---

## 1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD) - Context Level

This diagram illustrates the Library Management System as a single process, showing its interaction with external entities (Library User and Librarian).
